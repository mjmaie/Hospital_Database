1. Introduction
   1. Purpose:
        The purpose of this document is to outline the product we are developing for Dr. Ingrid Russel (the client).
   2. Scope:
        We will build a Graphical User Interface for a hospital database that has several facets.  This interface will allow registration staff, physicians, nurses, and billing staff to log in to the system. These users will be able to manage patient data in the database.

   5. Overview:
Throughout the remainder of this  document, we will discuss the specifics of our project. We will be covering the core functions of our project, the constraints and limitations of the project, the assumptions we make and dependencies our project has (i.e. availability of certain software, etc.), the user interfaces and general user experience, the data storage and database management, and the availability, security and maintainability of our project. 


   2. General Description
   1. Product Perspective:
It will include Java coupled with an SQL Database, and be an independent product. 
   2. Product Functions:
Functions will include: login service for hospital staff additional faculty, registration for new hires, will allow to update current information to staff and faculty information, register and update patient personal information, access patient medical records, and allow access to patient billing information.
   3. User Characteristics:
Basic computer experience of any previous use of any websites (i.e. email, social media, e-services, etc) will be sufficient to interact with the interface.
   4. General Constraints:
Java is required. 
   5. Assumption and Dependencies:
We assume javafx and our SQL database ideas work together effectively, and that we won’t run into any Java-related limitations.
